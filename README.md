### Classification_Regression_Job_Prediction

#### HR Data Science Problem: Predict Employement based on the fellows creditionals.
*** Predictive Modeling,EDA, Visualization, RandomizedSearch Hypertuning a. two models 1. Classification: IF a fellow will be placed or not. 2. Regression: WHEN a fellow will be placed

Problem Statement
The journey to employment is not an easy one. We spend our time learning and developing skills to eventually get a job. The research conducted in the following notebook will focus on predicting if a fellow will be placed and the time it will take for a fellow to be placed. Throughout the notebook, I will derive insights around fellows and create two models to effectively predict if and when a fellow will be placed.

That being said, there are two models we are going to create in this case study:

Classification model: Whether or not the fellow will be placed.
Regression model: Predict the length that it will take a fellow to find placement.
The other questions that I will tackle in the research:

Overall placement, how many individuals in the program were placed?
Pathrise Placement, did pathrise have an impact?
What is the education of the fellows that were placed, did the education impact placement?
Duration until placement, how long does it take a fellow to be placed?
